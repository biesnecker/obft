# OBFT: an optimizing brainfuck transpiler

Because the world really needs another brainfuck implementation.

Comes with both an interpreter and (SOON) a transpiler.

Mostly intended as a playground to better understand how to write programming
language-related code, but potentially interesting to others, too.

# Build

Clone the source and run `make`.

# Run

```
# Interpreter

./obft -i mybrainfuckprogram.b
```
